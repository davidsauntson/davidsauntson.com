          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>
            A capable, experienced and personable senior software engineer / tech lead with over 12 yearsâ€™ experience building and maintaining websites, web applications and APIs.  
            An experienced line manager and mentor with tech lead experience, I'm looking for a role where I can make meaningful individual contributions whilst working as part of a team.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy creating simple, functional and accessible sites and apps using frameworks like Ruby on Rails and React.  
            An excellent team worker with a long history of collaborative creation with developers, designers, account managers and product owners.
          </p>
          <p>
            I might struggle to work out the big O notiation of bubble sort or navigate a binary tree on demand; but I can work with a product designer to meet
            a user need or communicate risk to a non-technical stakeholder.  I enjoy working with other people to solve real world problems and deliver
            products that people will find useful.  I prefer working with a stable, well-tested codebase in small, diverse and happy teams.

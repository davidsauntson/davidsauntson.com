# Lord's Matchday Scorecard

A beautiful, performant and responsive live cricket scorecard app powered by React and Redux.

Using React and Redux to create a versatile app that processes an XML feed to provide live updates, statistics and commentary for the Lord's cricket website. Used on the site during live matches, the app performs well under exceptional demand. A polling module checks a constantly updating XML store to provide automatic updates to the scoring information.

Interactive chart and 'wagonwheel' elements created by a custom canvas element show runs scored and direction of ball travel for each hit (I never learnt the cricket domain specific language, alas).

The whole app is integrated into an existing content management system via a simple script tag inclusion on a specific template. An elegant and effective solution to a complex problem - delivered ahead of time and under budget.

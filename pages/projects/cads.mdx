# Citizens Advice Design System

Working with a front-end engineer and two product designers, we created a design system that now powers almost all public facing digital products 
at Citizens Advice.

The design system uses ITCSS and the BEM nomenclature to provide a low-specificity, readable and easily maintainable collection of styles and utilty classes that encourgae semantic HTML markup.  There are a couple of simple javascript modules for common components like accordions, disclosures and headers.  These are distrbuted via npm.  Common components are extracted into ViewComponents and tested via a demo app.

CADS has saved countless engineer hours over its lifetime, enabled rapid prototyping, ensured consistency for our users and shared baked-in accessibilty features across our digital estate.

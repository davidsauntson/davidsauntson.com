Working as part of a team to complete the front end build using SASS and BEM to create an extendible and easily maintainable front end code base. Created a large selection of responsive and fast templates using modular HTML components, SCSS files and ES6 classes for a high-demand multi-lingual site.

## Features

- Semantic HTML
- ES6 classes
- Modular SASS using the BEM technique
- VMWare, Webpack and node build tools used to create a fast and replicable front end build stack

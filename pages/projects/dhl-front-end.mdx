# DHL Front End and AMP Templates

Working the very wonderful and talented [Abigail Norris](https://abigailnorris.carbonmade.com/) to complete the front end build using SASS and BEM to create an extendible and easily maintainable front end code base. Created a large selection of responsive and fast templates using modular HTML components, SCSS files and ES6 classes for a high-demand multi-lingual site.

## Front end

  altText="The hero section of a lovely DHL Discover article page.  A graphic representation of a logistics centre lends context to the bold and engaging article headline."
  caption="The DHL hero component, in situ on an article page template."
  width={1440}
  height={900}
/>

### Features

- Semantic HTML
- ES6 classes
- Modular SASS using the BEM technique
- VMWare, Webpack and node build tools used to create a fast and replicable front end build stack

## AMP Templates

After the success of the DHL front end build, I extended the modular HTML and SASS code base to create AMP compliant HTML templates and stylesheets. This was my first experience with AMP and required research into the benefits and restrictions to ensure the new markup was AMP valid and integrated properly into the CMS.

  altText="Some good altext"
  caption="One of the simple, beautiful and accessible templates used  by Citizens Advice."
  width={411}
  height={731}
  portrait={true}
/>

### Development

- research into AMP restrictions and requirements
- extension of existing code base to provide AMP valid stylesheets
- implementation of standardised AMP modules to provide navigation, carousel and accordion functionality
- implementation of correct head meta tags

[See an example of an AMP template for DHL](https://discover.dhl.com/business/market-intelligence/changing-chinese-shopping-habits/How-has-COVID-19-changed-Chinese-shopping-habits)

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout>
    <Head pageTitle="Projects, DHL Front End" />
    <Breadcrumbs
      crumbs={[
        { title: "Home", url: "/" },
        { title: "Projects" },
        { title: "DHL Front End" },
      ]}
    />
    <main id="main-content">{children}</main>
  </Layout>
);

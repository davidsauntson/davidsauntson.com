# Citizens Advice Websites

Two Rails apps - a JSON API with a Postgres database to fetch data from our CMS (Contentful), and a ViewComponent based front end presentational layer with a couple of small React apps.  Deployed to AWS using the AWS CDK, kubernetes and helm.

My inital work on these apps focussed on accessiblity and ensuring our site is compliant with WCAG guidelines (AA).  Since then I have co-authored and maintained and organisation wide design system, led on updating our content model, helped migrate from a legacy CMS and implemented a number of features and refactors by working collaboratively with other engineers, product managers and designers.

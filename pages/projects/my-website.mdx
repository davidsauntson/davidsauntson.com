# My website

Stuck in lockdown 3.0 with a week of annual leave to use up, I decided to play with a(nother) React framework and static site generation.

This site is built using <code>next.js</code>, and hosted and deployed using Vercel. I have kept the design and simple, fun and clear, whilst implementing as many accessibility features as I can.

<ImageWithCaption
  src="/davidsauntson.png"
  altText="A clear and simple home page that focuses on clear and accessible content."
  caption="The homepage of this actual site, showing an emphasis on content and accessibility."
  width={1440}
  height={900}
/>

## Fun things I used to build this site

- <code>next.js</code> and Vercel
- MDX and CSS modules
- no custom javascript
- image optimisation
- [alt text as poetry](https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/)

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout>
    <Head pageTitle="Projects | My Website" />
    <Breadcrumbs
      crumbs={[
        { title: "Home", url: "/" },
        { title: "Projects" },
        { title: "My Website (this one)" },
      ]}
    />
    <main id="main-content">{children}</main>
  </Layout>
);

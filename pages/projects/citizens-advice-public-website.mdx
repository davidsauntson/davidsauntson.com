# Citizens Advice

At Citizens Advice I work on a team that is replacing the existing episerver powered public website and internal advice dispensing tool, AdviserNet, with a modern ruby-on-rails and Contentful powered web app.

A large part of my role is developing and maintaining a design system to ensure consistency of service across all Citizens Advice websites and apps. We are focussing on accessibility, simplicity and getting our content to our auidence, regardless of their technology, digital literacy or accessibility requirements.

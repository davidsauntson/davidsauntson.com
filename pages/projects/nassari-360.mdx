# Nassari 360

I created an enterprise level, software-as-a-service subscription based application for Nassari 360 Ltd. Users subscribe to the service to create individual 360 degree interactive microsites powered by React. I completed all elements of the application, including requirements capture, software architecutre (using various design patterns), database and domain object design as well as all coding, test scripting, deployment and maintenance.

The software is hosted on Microsoft Azure and uses various Azure services to provide functionality to the end user. Bitbucket pipelines are employed to provide CI and one-click deployments, backed up by automated tests written in nightwatch.js and blue/green deployments for zero downtime.

## .NET App

  altText="The back end of the Nassari 360 application shows a list of scenes in a project with an intuitive and modern interface."
  caption="The project management screen that lets you add and edit scenes in a microsite."
  width={1440}
  height={900}
/>

### Features

- ASP .NET Core 2 web application
- Powered by Azure - multi slot web app, CDN, SQL DB, storage
- Continuous integration and deployment using Bitbucket Pipelines
- Automated testing using nightwatch.js
- Third party API integrations (Zoho Subscriptions, Mailjet)
- grunt and npm front end build stack

## React Microsite Example

Interactive, 360 degree experiential websites powered by React for Nassari 360 Ltd. The output of a .NET MVC Core application, the content, appearance and behaviour of these single page applications are controlled by a single JSON file and a performant React / Redux application.

Media, styles and content are extracted from a JSON file and put into a redux store which dispatches various actions to render the site and create the required behaviour.

<ImageWithCaption
  src="/galaxy.jpg"
  altText="A large 360 degree image of our galaxy fills the screen, with some details and links to other pages on the microsite at the bottom."
  caption="An example of the microsites generated by the app."
  width={1440}
  height={900}
/>

### Features

- React/Redux powered microsites
- Fully themeable using style information in a JSON file
- webpack, grunt, SCSS / BEM powered front end stack
- Hosted in Azure storage
